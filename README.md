Fidelity (known as "John Bara Script") is a module to optimize the Windows Operating System for high performance, low latency and better battery life.

# Components of Fidelity

Fidelity uses Windows Library to Optimize your system. These more type of system optimization and tweaks. There are of 2 types:
1. EAS - it uses registry and batch to optimize the system. It applies last registry tweaks for specified Windows Version and a batch which is removing services and unwanted system Tasks and disables Telemetry using Firewall Rules.
Also is coming with a host, which is playing as an "System Ad-Blcoker".

✳️ Windows Defender is not be Removed , and you can do Windows Updates, but you will NOT be annonyed by Updates..
✳️ After applying Fidelity, uBlock Origin plugin installed in your browser. Also we added CleanURL for privacy and better web experience, PiP Support for Google Chrome and a Youtube Enchanter.
 
 2. Non-EAS - it uses same EAS types but in addition with removal of system packages. We are using install_wim_tweak to remove these. It makes your system lighter, smoother and faster, but it makes unupdatable.
✳️ With non-EAS , you CANNOT apply Windows Updates. To apply Windows Updates, create a ISO Image (from uupdump.net) apply it and apply again the fidelity version. We are recommend to apply this for every 3-6 months.

## Installation
